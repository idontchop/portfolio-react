                    I've heard programmers are often asked how old they were when they first started writing code. <b>Answer: </b> 13.
                    And when did I complete and release my first piece of software? I was 15. It was a BBS door game
                    written in Turbo C++ using the OpenDoors Library. I even made a couple hundred bucks on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Alas, the World Wide Web interrupted my plans for the SciFi war game sequel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After high school I went to work for an ISP, shortly before cable internet.
                    Using the provider's T1 line, I installed a Debian server and learned how to <b>host web sites</b> (and mail,
                    dns, mysql, etc). A year
                    or so later, I had a few servers colocated with that ISP's ISP, hee hee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In another few years, after struggling through the dot-com crash, I sold my customer base and servers (then up to about 40)
                    to a larger hosting company in Atlanta, helped them through the transition and then swore off
                    the IT industry for the gambling industry. Maybe not the best decision... But I had done well
                    for a high school graduate who started with a book on C++.

                  class="rounded mx-auto d-block" alt="Java Poker Tools" />
                  <p>From then to now, I occasionally rediscovered coding for certain projects,
                    such as a <a href="https://github.com/idontchop/pokerTools">poker hand range equity calculator</a> (github),
                    and a <a href="https://github.com/idontchop/crypto_exchange_rate_pull_py">python script</a> to pull the
                    crypto-coin prices from exchanges to check for trades.

                    And Now...
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    I recently graduated from <b>Western Governor's University</b> with a <b>BSIT - Software Programmers</b>
                    degree. Just one of those things as a mid-30s adult you feel you need to do to be taken
                    seriously. Honestly, I didn't learn much. Even the late 90s C++ programming books I studied talked of
                    clean coding and design patterns. It's not a new idea. Sure, it's been refined, with frameworks
                    like <b>Spring</b> and paradigms like <b>functional programming</b>. They sure take the tediousness
                    out of the work. Not the testing and bug-hunting though. I do more now than I remember doing before, maybe
                    because I now understand the importance of it... and there will always be bugs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My capstone was a <a href="https://github.com/idontchop/IdcCloudService">Spring REST backend</a> for my Java Poker Tools app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm most comfortable in <b>Java 8</b>, after tearing myself away from the for (;;) loops of <b>C++</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p> <b>Spring,
                    Hibernate</b>, and other libraries commonly used with Spring (<b>AOP, Spring Security</b>), are of high interest to
                    me and is where I'm focused. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>React</b> has made Javascript and web-based UI/UX a pleasure, and I have aspirations of my first
                    dollar made from my own app since I was a teenager... unless someone hires me first.
